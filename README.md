## Portfolio Website

This is my software engineering portfolio website. It is a simple React app that includes links to my resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Dev.to blog. It also has a client side route to an About Me page with a short bio and a list of my skills. If you'd like to get in touch, please use the links provided on the site to connect!
